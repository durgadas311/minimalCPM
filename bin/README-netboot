How to setup a demo using the simulator and network boot

These instructions are oriented for Linux/Unix(MAC OSX) systems.
For Windows, some of these steps need to change. The following files
need to be customized. However, the boot method must be chosen:

For the "network boot" option the CP/NOS image(s) reside on the server.
 
2. == vmincpm-nb.rc ==
2.1	Change 'cpnet_server00' "/path/to/MinCPM" to reflect the full path
	to where you want your CP/NET server 00 drives.  After creating
	this top-level directory, create subdirectories there named 'a'
	through 'p'.

2.2	Change the host/IP and port for 'cpnet_console' (TelnetSerial)
	to reflect your local IP address and a free port number.

2.3	Change 'monitor_rom' to reflect the name of the ROM image created
	in 1.1 (if different).

2.4	Change 'netboot_dir' to reflect the desired directory for the
	network boot images. This may be the same top-level directory
	used in 'cpnet_server00'.

2.5	Optionally un-comment the 'debugger' property. This enables
	some simple debugging commands on the simulator. See DEBUGGER
	for more information.

2.6	Optionally un-comment the 'log' property, and set the desired
	log file name. Normally, the simulator output is fairly limited
	but when using the 'debugger' it is desirable to have the output
	saved to a file.

3. == serialserver ==
3.1	Modify the shell variable "JAR1" to reference the actual path to
	the file CpnetSerialServer.jar.

3.2	Modify the shell variable "JAR2" to reference the actual path to
	the downloaded file jSerialComm-2.6.2.jar.

4. == /path/to/MinCPM ==
4.1	Populate the chosen path for drive A: (e.g. /path/to/MinCPM/a)
	with CP/NET and CP/M 2.2 utilities. The minimum required are
	the files in the 'dist' subdirectory of this repository.
	Additionally, CP/M 2.2 programs may be useful, such as
	"stat.com", "ddt.com", etc.

4.2	Add the "cpnos.sys" to the top level directory, or whatever
	directory was specified for 'netboot_dir'.

To run the simulation, use the command:

	java -jar VirtualMinCpm.jar vmincpm-nb.rc

To connect to the console, run "telnet 192.168.1.17 31123"
(substituting the host/IP and port chosen in step 2.2), or
an equivalent program, to connect. Note, telnet is not strictly
required - any TCP/IP socket connection should work.
Note that telnet needs to be running in "character" mode
in order to function properly. Use the "mode character" command
after starting, or else setup an entry in your .telnetrc file like:

	192.168.1.17
		mode character

Once connected to the console, you should see:

	Minimal System Monitor v0.5

	: 

Typing "?(cr)" will show a brief help of monitor commands:

	: ?
	B <sid> [string] - network boot
	D <start> <end> - display memory in HEX
	S <start> - set/view memory
	G <start> - go to address
	F <start> <end> <data> - fill memory
	M <start> <end> <dest> - Move data
	I <port> - Input from port
	O <port> <value> - Output to port
	V - Show ROM version
	: 

To start CP/NET (CP/NOS) type the command "B(cr)":

	: B
	COBIOS   SPR  FE00 0200
	COBDOS   SPR  FB00 0300
	SNIOS    SPR  F800 0300
	NDOS     SPR  EC00 0C00

	59K TPA
	A>

At this point, you are in a familiar CP/M "CCP" environment.
One useful CP/NET command is "netstat" to show the network
mappings:

	A>netstat

	CP/NET Status
	=============
	Requester ID = F0H
	Network Status Byte = 10H
	Device status:
	  Drive A: = Drive A: on Network Server ID = 00H
	  List Device = List #0 on Network Server ID = 00H
	A>

By default, only A: and LST: are networked. Since no local disks
exist, the rest need to be networked as desired.

The default/sample server configuration does not setup a LST: device,
and only provides one server (00). However, that configuration may
be expanded.

To network another drive, use the "network" command. For example,
to assign local drive B: to server 00 drive P:, use:

	network b:=p:[0]

Since server 00 is the default, the "[0]" could have been omitted.
