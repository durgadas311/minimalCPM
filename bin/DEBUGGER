Simulator Debugger Commands

The simulator debugger, selected by the property 'debugger',
uses the terminal stdin to enter commands. This is the same
terminal/window where the 'java' command was entered.

Commands:

reset	Causes the virtual system to be reset. This is virtually
	the same as a hardware RESET.

quit	Exit the simulation. Typically, a ^C will have the same effect.

dump cpu
	Print information about the current CPU state.

dump mach
	Print information about the current machine state.

dump asci
	Print information about the current ASCI state.

dump page XX
	Dump memory page XX, in the context of the current system
	state. This is a "virtual" or logical CPU page address in the
	64K address space.
	(future: add capability to dump by physical addresses)

dump core <file>
	Dump all of memory to the specified file. The dump will be
	sparse, with the memory chunks physically residing at their
	physical addresses. The ROM will begin at byte 0x00000 of the
	file, and RAM will begin at byte 0x80000 of the file.

trace off
	Turn off, stop, disable, any previously set tracing.

trace on
	Start tracing all instructions. Beware! This can consume the
	output very quickly.

trace cycles N
	Trace the next N CPU clock cycles. Note, this is not the number of
	instructions. Typically, numbers between 100 and 1000 are useful.

trace pc SSSS EEEE
	Trace all instructions executed between logical addresses SSSS
	(inclusive) and EEEE (exclusive).  Be aware that this can also
	produce a lot of output under the right conditions.
